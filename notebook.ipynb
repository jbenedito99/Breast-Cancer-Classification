    "Breast cancer is a prevalent disease that affects a plethora of people, mainly women, worldwide. It accounts for 12.5% of all new cancer cases, deeming it the most common cancer in the world. In the United States, around 30% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in women are breast cancer. 1 in 8 U.S. women are expected to develop breast cancer some time in their life. Currently, more than 4 million U.S. women have a history of breast cancer. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 more women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023 (https://www.breastcancer.org/facts-statistics). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the statistics, it is obvious why accurate screenings are important. The sooner a doctor is able to catch breast cancer in a patient’s imaging, the more likely they can get lifesaving treatment before their disease progresses. My main stakeholders for this project are gynecologists and other medical professionals who are in charge of examining X-rays of tumors. I want them to know the top characteristics to look out for when determining whether a tumor is cancerous or not."

    "The first dataset I will be using is called <b>breast-cancer.csv</b>, which was downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and houses information from the Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database. Each row represents a cell in a tumor. Each column is a different cellular characteristic, such as mean radius and mean concavity, which was calculated from a fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsy image of a breast mass. The target variable is the <b>diagnosis</b> column, which has an 'M' to denote 'malignant' and a 'B' to signify 'benign'.\n",

From <b>.value_counts()</b>, we see that there is some slight class imbalance within the dataset. A 'B' indicates a 'benign' tumor while an 'M' signifies 'malignancy'. Based on the values for each binary indicator, we see that the data is split almost 60-40 with about 60% of the tumors being classified as benign and around 40% of the tumors in the dataset being diagnosed as malignant. Because the minority class makes up <b>more than 10%</b> of the dataset, I will consider there to be no class imbalance problem that needs to be addressed. While there are no null values and class imbalance, one thing that still must be done is changing the letters in the categorical <b>diagnosis</b> column. I will use the <b>.replace()</b> method to change 'B' to an integer of '0' and 'M' to an integer of '1'. I will employ <b>.value_counts()</b> to confirm that the replacement was successful. "

    "Considering the context of our business problem, <b>the model's ability to detect true positives (malignancy) is more important</b> because these represent <b>patients who have breast cancer</b>. Our goal should be <b>reducing the Type 2 error rate</b> as much as possible because these are errors where someone was <b>predicted to have a benign tumor that was actually malignant (cancerous)</b>. However, <b>bringing down the Type 1 error rate</b> is also important because we don't want to give patients a cancer scare who don't really have the disease. Comparing both error types, Type 2 errors can be more fatal; if a patient is deemed as having a non-cancerous tumor when it's actually cancerous, this will prevent them from getting potentially life-saving treatment right away. Therefore, while both error types are bad, if we had to choose, keeping the Type 2 error rate low should be our top priority."

Instead of using the default parameters like the baseline, we can do some tree \"pruning\" and see if it improves the model's performance. By comparing the training and test scores earlier, we saw that the baseline decision tree did better accuracy-wise on the training data as compared to the test data, thus indicating possible overfitting. One way to reduce this overfitting issue is to adjust <b>max_depth</b>. I will determine the optimal max_depth for the training and test data by graphing various depth values against their AUC score."

    "From the classification report, we see that the metrics were similar for both classes (benign and malignant tumors) across the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>precision</b>, which is a measure of true positives versus the total number of predicted positives, was <b>100% for benign tumors</b> and <b>95% for malignant tumors</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Recall</b>, which is a measure of positives that were correctly identified, was <b>97% for the benign</b> class and <b>100% for the malignant</b> class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the <b>f1_score</b>, which takes both precision and recall into account and is the percent of positive predictions that were correct, was <b>99% for benign</b> and <b>97% for malignant</b> tumors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the precision, recall, and f1_score metrics were similar values for both benign and malignant tumors, this is further proof that <b>class imbalance was not an issue</b>. On top of that, the <b>accuracy</b> of the chosen model was <b>98%</b> on the test data. More importantly, there were <b>no Type 2 errors (false negatives)</b>. This was of utmost importance because patients with breast cancer need to be properly diagnosed. All in all, the <b>forest_baseline</b> classifier is strong in many evaluation areas."

In addition, overfitting is no longer an issue, since the training and testing scores are around the same value. The <b>confusion matrix</b> displays a slight decrease in Type 1 and Type 2 errors. The number of <b>false positives</b> has gone down from 15 to 11. Similarly, the number of <b>false negatives</b> has decreased from 18 to 13. The improvements in this regard are solid; however, considering we are dealing with real patients, that means there are still 13 of them who are being diagnosed with a benign tumor that is actually malignant. While we are making progress in the right direction, there remains room to improve the classification model to a further extent. "

However, despite the improvements, we see from our <b>false negatives</b> section of the matrix that 10 patients are still being diagnosed as having benign tumors that are actually malignant. Putting it in this context, we should continue our iterative modeing process to see if we can get even better results. On the bright side, <b>forest_tuned_mm</b> is the best model we've yielded so far for the <b>mammographic masses</b> dataset (in terms of accuracy). From our training and testing scores, we also see no more evidence of overfitting, since they are closer to each other in quantity."

The 10 false negatives are the biggest concern because this value represents 10 patients who have breast cancer who weren't diagnosed. Comparing <b>knn_baseline_mm</b> to the <b>decision tree</b> models and <b>random forest</b> classifiers created earlier, this model we just made has the best performance, in terms of accuracy. Between the training and testing scores, we see that the baseline KNN performed better with the testing data, having an accuracy of about 88%, whereas on the training data, it had an accuracy of around 85%. This is an indicator of <b>underfitting</b>. Let's try to address this problem by tuning some hyperparameters."

    "## Limitations and Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier for the <b>breast cancer</b> dataset had strong accuracy. It was able to correctly identify all malignant cells in the test set, which was the most important thing to detect. The only limitation of this dataset is its size; it contained quantified data for 569 images of cells in a single tumor. The chosen model should be used on a larger amount of data to see how it performs, particularly other tumors. \n",

    "For the <b>mammographic masses</b> dataset, the accuracy was decent. However, considering that this model has the intention of being used for diagnostic purposes, having <b>10 false negatives</b> is still a significant amount when putting it in context. 10 patients receiving an incorrect diagnosis for their malignant tumor can have fatal effects that prevents them from getting potentially life-saving treatment right away. In the future, other classifier types should be experimented with for this particular dataset to see if better performance can be yielded. In addition, the hyperparameters for the final chosen model could possibly be tuned even further; only an optimal k-value was introduced, but there are other parameters that can potentially be optimized that may lead to greater accuracy and less Type 2 errors.
